Modern living involves remote connection, and clear image and video is essential for productive cooperation and communication. This project addresses the growing need for enhanced remote communication experiences by utilizing the capabilities of the Zybo Z7-20. The proposed image and video processing system has the potential to transform remote communication and bridge the gap between physical and virtual interactions.
The primary objective is to develop an image processing system and then enhance the image using various algorithms. In this, we will be testing various algorithms to see which is  best for Enhancing an image. For the second part we will be developing a video processing system. In this, we will be using a video link to show the processing taking place instead of using the live stream from the HD webcam. In this video processing, we will be implementing various filters like the canny edge detection filter and Harnis corner detection filter etc to enhance the Video. Next, we will make color detection from the live stream that is being captured in the webcam.
In conclusion, this project will be reshaping the landscape of remote communication. By harnessing the power of the Zybo Z7-20 and implementing a cascade of advancements, from image Enhancing algorithms to live video enhancement and color detection, the project demonstrates the potential to revolutionize the way we connect remotely.
